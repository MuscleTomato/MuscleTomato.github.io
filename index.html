Hello! I am a Research Assistant focusing on Robotics Manipulation, Robotics Magical Tricks, Temporal Logic, and Causality at the ASU Department of Mechanical Engineering, working with Dr. Zhe Xu.

Prior to that, I was a Master's and undergraduate student at Xi'an Jiaotong University starting in 2017, where I focused on Reduced Order Models and Dynamical System Algorithms.
